## Basic Challenge
Multiple systems and write-blockers can be expensive. The basic challenge allows students to analyze evidence on the seized system. Evidence photographs are also not required. Students are required to wear latex gloves while handling the evidence.

## Advanced Challenge
This challenge requires two laptops: one as seized evidence and the other as an investigators system. Challenge also requires a USB write-blocker (https://www.amazon.com/CRU-Inc-31300-0192-0000-WiebeTech-WriteBlocker/dp/B002DH1P0W), SD media card reader, and a digital camera. Students are required to log and photograph all evidence. Analysis of USB drives and SD cards must be completed on the investigator system with write blockers. Students are required to wear latex gloves while handling the evidence.
